      <p class="text-grey mt-2">
        We live in a globalized world where we can find any products that are
        produced in any other countries in this world. The world business has
        been centralized like never before. The opportunities to start and grow
        a business have highly increased because of the high demand in the local
        market. At present, because of the google.com we can get to know any
        product that is produced in any corner of the world and import it to
        fulfill our needs. The global data shows because of the effective supply
        chain in local and international market, the scope of initiating and
        growing business in a local market with small capital has increased many
        fold. This picture also reflects in our countryâ€™s scenario too. We can
        see lots of small business initiative mushrooming up in many houses in
        this pandemic situation, as the supply chain has increased its

      <h6 class="mt-4">How to import and start or grow your business?</h6>
      <p class="text-grey mt-2">
        So now the question arises how we can import and start or grow our
        business? There are many steps and consideration to keep in mind while
        taking steps to import. The most important is choosing the product to
        import or in broad sense which segment to target to import. Targeting
        the segment or products to work with is very important. First thing
        first, you have to know thoroughly about the product. All the details
        you have to have a clear idea. It is not like you wake up one fine
        morning and decide to import school bags, cosmetics or any other things.
        A detail research is a must before you choose a segment to import.

        Import raw materials to make finished products in Bangladesh and to
        Export
      </h6>
      <p class="text-grey mt-2">
        Now, you can also import raw materials to produce a finished product in
        Bangladesh. It is not always that you have to import finished products
        to sell in Bangladesh. You can import raw materials form different
        countries and make the final product in here and sell in local and
        export too. The biggest example is our garments industry. The garments
        sector import lots of fabrics and other accessories from abroad before
        making the final products in Bangladesh to export and sell locally too.
        So here the point is, if you have an existing business and want to
        automate and develop or expand your product portfolio. You can import
        machineries and different raw materials from foreign countries to
        diversify your product range and expand your business.
